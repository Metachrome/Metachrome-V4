# 🔍 Detailed Debugging Steps

## Current Status

✅ Test endpoint works - users CAN be created in Supabase
❌ Signup endpoint - users NOT appearing in admin dashboard
❌ Document upload - 401 errors
❌ New users not in admin dashboard

---

## What We Know

1. **Supabase connection works** - test endpoint creates users successfully
2. **Admin dashboard reads from Supabase** - manually created user appears
3. **Problem is in signup endpoint** - users created through signup don't appear in Supabase

---

## Step 1: Try Signup Again

1. Go to your app
2. Sign up with a **NEW email** (e.g., `test.debug@example.com`)
3. **DO NOT upload document yet**
4. Note the username you used

---

## Step 2: Check Railway Logs

1. Go to **Railway Dashboard**
2. Select your **server service**
3. Click **Logs** tab
4. Search for logs with your username (e.g., `test.debug`)
5. **Copy ALL logs** that contain:
   - `[SIGNUP]` - signup endpoint logs
   - `[CREATE_USER]` - user creation logs
   - `❌` - any errors

---

## Step 3: Check Supabase

1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Click **SQL Editor**
3. Run this query:
```sql
SELECT id, username, email, created_at 
FROM users 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

4. **Check if your test user appears**
   - If YES: User was created in Supabase, but admin dashboard not showing it
   - If NO: User was NOT created in Supabase

---

## Step 4: Check Admin Dashboard

1. Go to **Admin Dashboard**
2. Click **Users** tab
3. **Search for your test user**
   - If found: Admin dashboard is working
   - If not found: Admin dashboard not reading from Supabase

---

## What to Share With Me

Please provide:

1. **Your test username** (e.g., `test.debug`)
2. **Railway logs** containing `[SIGNUP]` and `[CREATE_USER]`
3. **Result of Supabase SQL query** (does user appear?)
4. **Result of admin dashboard search** (does user appear?)

## Expected Logs (If Working)

```
📝 [SIGNUP] Starting registration for: testuser
📝 [SIGNUP] Checking if user already exists...
📝 [SIGNUP] Checking if email already exists...
📝 [SIGNUP] Hashing password...
📝 [SIGNUP] Creating user with data: {...}
📝 [SIGNUP] isSupabaseConfigured: true supabase exists: true
📝 [SIGNUP] Calling createUser()...
🔍 [CREATE_USER] Called - isSupabaseConfigured: true supabase exists: true
📝 [CREATE_USER] Attempting minimal insert to Supabase: {...}
✅ [CREATE_USER] User created in Supabase: testuser ID: 550e8400-...
✅ [SIGNUP] User created in database: 550e8400-...
✅ [SIGNUP] User source: Supabase (UUID)
```

## Expected Logs (If Failing)

Look for:
- `❌ [CREATE_USER] Supabase insert error:`
- `❌ [CREATE_USER] Error code:`
- `❌ [CREATE_USER] Error message:`
- `🔄 [CREATE_USER] Falling back to file storage...`

## Next Steps

Once you provide the logs and Supabase query results, I can:
1. Identify the exact error
2. Fix it immediately
3. Test it works
4. Deploy the fix
