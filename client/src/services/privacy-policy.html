    <p>Where we rely on <strong>consent</strong>, you can withdraw it at any time without affecting prior processing. Where we rely on <strong>legitimate interests</strong>, we balance them against your rights and expectations.</p>

    <h2>7) Cookies &amp; Similar Technologies</h2>
    <p>We use cookies, local storage, pixels and SDKs for essential functions, analytics, personalization, and (where applicable) advertising. You can manage preferences via your browser settings and our cookie controls (if available). Blocking some cookies may impact functionality. See our Cookie Notice (if provided) for details.</p>

    <h2>8) Sharing Your Data</h2>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal data. We may share data with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service providers/processors:</strong> hosting, KYC/AML, payments, analytics, security, communications, storage, support.</li>
      <li><strong>Affiliates/group companies:</strong> for operations consistent with this Policy.</li>
      <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> in mergers, acquisitions, or asset sales (your data may transfer with the business).</li>
      <li><strong>Legal &amp; compliance:</strong> to comply with law, lawful requests, sanctions obligations, or to protect rights, property, users, or the public.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9) International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Your data may be processed in countries outside your own, which may have different data protection laws. Where required, we use appropriate safeguards such as the <strong>EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)</strong>, UK IDTA/Addendum, and additional measures when necessary. You can request a copy of relevant safeguards via <a href="mailto:privacy@metachrome.io">privacy@metachrome.io</a>.</p>

    <h2>10) Data Security</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Encryption in transit (TLS) and at rest (where appropriate, e.g., AES‑256 for sensitive fields).</li>
      <li>Access controls, audit logging, and least‑privilege permissions.</li>
      <li>Network protections (firewalls, IDS/IPS), vulnerability scanning and patching.</li>
      <li>Incident response program and regular risk assessments.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No system is 100% secure. We implement safeguards appropriate to the risk and will notify authorities/users where legally required in case of a breach.</p>

    <h2>11) Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We keep personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes above, including meeting legal, accounting, and reporting requirements (e.g., KYC/AML retention periods typically 5–10 years depending on jurisdiction). When no longer needed, we will delete or irreversibly anonymize it.</p>

    <h2>12) Your Rights (GDPR &amp; Similar)</h2>
    <p>Subject to conditions and local law, you have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Access</strong> your data and obtain a copy;</li>
      <li><strong>Rectify</strong> inaccurate or incomplete data;</li>
      <li><strong>Erase</strong> data (where applicable);</li>
      <li><strong>Restrict</strong> processing in certain cases;</li>
      <li><strong>Object</strong> to processing based on legitimate interests or for direct marketing;</li>
      <li><strong>Data portability</strong> (receive data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format);</li>
      <li><strong>Withdraw consent</strong> where processing is based on consent;</li>
      <li><strong>Complain</strong> to your supervisory authority.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Requests: contact <a href="mailto:privacy@metachrome.io">privacy@metachrome.io</a>. We may need to verify your identity. We aim to respond within one month (extendable where permitted).</p>
    <p><strong>Automated decisions:</strong> Where automated decision-making or profiling has legal or similarly significant effects, you may request human review, express your point of view, and contest the decision.</p>

    <h2>13) Marketing Choices</h2>
    <p>You can opt out of marketing emails by clicking “unsubscribe” or emailing us. You may still receive essential transactional/operational messages. For cookies used for advertising, adjust your browser/device settings and our cookie controls (if available).</p>

    <h2>14) Children</h2>
    <p>The Platform is not directed to individuals under 18. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided us data, contact us and we will delete it where required by law.</p>

    <h2>15) Third‑Party Sites &amp; Services</h2>
    <p>The Platform may link to third‑party websites, services, or plug‑ins. Their privacy practices are governed by their policies, not this Policy. Review those policies carefully.</p>

    <h2>16) Do Not Track</h2>
    <p>Some browsers offer “Do Not Track” signals. Because there is no common industry standard, our Platform may not respond to DNT signals. You can control cookies via your browser.</p>

    <h2>17) Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date will change and, where required by law, you will be notified. Your continued use of the Platform after changes signifies acceptance.</p>
