    <div class="note">
      <p><strong>Important:</strong> By opening an account, using <a href="https://www.metachrome.io">metachrome.io</a> and/or any Services provided by Metachrome, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to these Terms of Service (the “Terms”). If you do not agree, you must cease using the Platform immediately.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>(1) Our Agreement</h2>
    <h3>1.1 Preliminaries</h3>
    <p>(a) These Terms govern the relationship between you (the “User”) and Metachrome (the “Company”, “Metachrome”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) regarding your use of the website and applications (the “Platform”), your account(s), and any services we provide (the “Services”).</p>
    <p>(b) These Terms incorporate by reference the Privacy Notice, AML/KYC Policy, Risk Disclosures, Fees &amp; Charges, and any rules, statements, instructions or policies we publish from time to time.</p>
    <p>(c) Metachrome operates an online venue for Users to transact in digital assets and access related Services. Natural persons or other subjects who access the Platform shall be “Users” or “you”. Collectively you and Metachrome are the “Parties”.</p>
    <p>(d) <strong>Territorial &amp; jurisdictional restrictions.</strong> Some Services are not offered where doing so would violate law or sanction regimes, and to individuals or entities subject to sanctions. We may restrict or prohibit all or part of the Services in certain jurisdictions (the “Excluded Jurisdictions”). Without limitation, Excluded Jurisdictions may include: Canada, the United States of America (including its territories and commonwealths), mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, United Arab Emirates, North Korea, Cuba, Iran, Syria, Sudan, Russian‑controlled regions of Ukraine, Somalia, Myanmar, Venezuela, and any other jurisdiction we may designate from time to time.

    <p>(f) These Terms apply to you and to any authorized person you appoint. You must ensure your authorized person complies with these Terms.</p>
    <p>(g) We may amend these Terms at our discretion by publishing an updated version on the Platform. The updated Terms take effect upon publication unless stated otherwise.</p>
    <p>(h) Nothing herein creates fiduciary, trustee, advisory, agency, partnership or joint venture duties/relationships between you and Metachrome.</p>
    <p>(i) Contra proferentem does not apply against a Party merely because that Party prepared the Terms.</p>

    <p>(g) We may change required data at any time, share/verify data within our Group or with trusted third parties, and refuse service at our discretion.</p>

    <h3>2.2 Maintenance of Account</h3>

    <p>(b) You warrant that any Digital Assets you transfer are lawfully owned and free of restrictions.</p>
    <p>(c) For blockchain transfers, you are solely responsible for using the correct network and address. Errors may result in permanent loss. We are not liable for such losses.</p>

    <p>(b) On‑Platform Assets may be held in wallets/custody arrangements within our Group or via service providers. Benefits from such arrangements may be retained by us. We are not liable for depreciation or loss not caused by our gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct.</p>

    <h2>(6) Platform Trading</h2>
    <p>(a) You may acquire/transfer Digital Assets via the Platform, subject to availability. Scheduled or emergency maintenance, outages, or other events may limit access.</p>
    <p>(b) We safeguard assets using a combination of cold storage, operational controls and other measures; however, custody carries inherent risks and any protection fund we maintain is at our discretion and is not insurance.</p>

    <h2>(7) Orders</h2>
    <h3>7.1 Making Orders</h3>
    <p>(a) You may submit Orders via Platform functions or other approved channels. Order types include Limit Orders, Market Orders, and others we may support.</p>
    <p>(b) You must have sufficient balances to cover Orders and applicable fees. Submitting an Order earmarks the relevant assets until execution or cancellation.</p>
    <p>(c) We may impose limits or requirements and cancel non‑compliant Orders.</p>
    <h3>7.2 Execution</h3>
    <p>(a) Orders are matched based on market conditions and availability. Execution is not guaranteed and delays may occur. Platform calculations and methods are posted on the Platform.</p>
    <h3>7.3 Transaction Information</h3>
    <p>(a) Review all details (price, fees, side) before confirming. Your submission authorizes us to match your Order automatically when a proposal meets your quote. You may review records in your Account dashboard.</p>

    <h2>(8) Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>(a) The Platform, content, software, design, trademarks and all related intellectual property (“IP”) are owned by Metachrome or its licensors and are protected by law. We grant you a personal, limited, non‑exclusive, non‑transferable right to use the Platform. You must not copy, modify, distribute, scrape, or commercially exploit the IP without written consent.</p>
    <p>(b) Content you submit may be used, modified, displayed and distributed by us for Platform operations, without compensation, subject to applicable law.</p>

    <h2>(9) Rights of Metachrome</h2>
    <p>We may amend Terms; impose access limits; change, suspend or remove features; and decline, cancel or reverse Orders/Transactions to protect Platform integrity or comply with law. We may revoke dormant Accounts, require further KYC, or remove content that violates law or Platform rules.</p>

    <h2>(10) Role of Metachrome</h2>
    <p>We provide an online venue only and do not act as your broker, advisor or fiduciary. We do not assess suitability. You are solely responsible for decisions, and we do not guarantee market information, availability, or outcomes. Conflicts of interest may arise; you accept these risks.</p>

    <h2>(11) Prevention of Market Misconduct</h2>
    <p>Insider trading, wash trading, spoofing, pump‑and‑dump, front‑running, manipulation, and other illicit activities are prohibited. We may warn, restrict, forfeit illicit profits, close accounts, and notify authorities. We may disclose your contact information to regulators/law enforcement where reasonably suspected illegal activity occurs.</p>

    <h2>(12) Warranties &amp; Representations</h2>
    <p>You represent and warrant on a continuing basis that you have capacity; understand and accept these Terms and risks; are the beneficial owner of your Account and assets; act as principal; do not use jailbroken devices; will make independent decisions; and are not subject to actions that compromise enforceability. You must comply with Platform rules, keep credentials secure, and bear all taxes and costs incurred.</p>

    <h2>(13) Risks</h2>
    <p>Digital asset markets are new, volatile and speculative. Prices can fluctuate sharply; you may lose all or more than your investment. Liquidity, availability, technological, cybersecurity, regulatory and third‑party risks apply. Internet‑based trading systems may fail or be interrupted. We do not provide investment advice. Review risk disclosures carefully and seek independent advice as needed.</p>

    <h2>(14) Forks</h2>
    <p>Underlying networks may change (a “Fork”), potentially creating Forked Networks and new assets. We may temporarily suspend services, determine which networks/assets to support, and may retain unsupported forked assets. You may have no right to withdraw unsupported assets. We are not liable for losses from Forks.</p>

    <h2>(15) Fiat Services</h2>
    <p>Where available, fiat on‑ramp/off‑ramp and conversions are provided by independent Payment Service Providers. Fiat transactions occur exclusively between you and such providers and are subject to their terms, fees, KYC/AML, and availability. We may modify, suspend, or terminate access to Fiat Services at our discretion.</p>

    <h2>(16) Indemnities &amp; Liabilities</h2>
    <h3>16.1 Indemnity</h3>
    <p>You will indemnify and hold harmless Metachrome and Related Persons against claims, losses, damages, costs and expenses arising from your breach of these Terms, violations of law, erroneous Instructions, failure to settle Orders, or other use of the Platform.</p>
    <h3>16.2 Exclusions &amp; Limitations</h3>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, punitive, consequential or exemplary damages (including loss of profits, data, business or opportunities), or for events beyond our reasonable control. Our total cumulative liability shall not exceed the Fees you paid to us in the twelve (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim.</p>

    <h2>(17) Termination, Suspension &amp; Enforcement</h2>
    <p>We may remove features, suspend or terminate Services or this Agreement, cancel Orders, and take steps necessary to protect the Platform, with or without notice, including where Services are unlawful in your jurisdiction, or you breach these Terms.</p>

    <h2>(18) Obligation to Minimize Impact</h2>
    <p>You acknowledge the industry’s evolving nature and agree to take reasonable steps to minimize impact to your assets/interests if assets, services, or accounts are restricted or terminated due to regulatory, issuer or platform actions (including seeking advice, rebalancing holdings, complying with law, and keeping contact details current).</p>

    <h2>(19) General Terms</h2>
    <p>(a) Independent parties; no agency or partnership. (b) We may revise these Terms; your continued use signifies acceptance. (c) Translations are for convenience; English prevails. (d) Force Majeure applies. (e) Severability and survival of valid provisions. (f) Assignment: you may not assign without consent; we may assign without notice. (g) Successors and assigns bound. (h) No waiver by failure to enforce. (i) Third‑party links &amp; technology disclaimers apply. (j) You are responsible for network access and compatible devices.</p>

    <h2>(20) Governing Law &amp; Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p>(a) <strong>Governing Law:</strong> These Terms, your use of the Platform and Services are governed by the laws of <strong>[Insert Governing Law/Jurisdiction]</strong>.</p>
    <p>(b) <strong>Arbitration:</strong> Except for excluded claims (e.g., IP/injunctive relief), any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services shall be finally resolved by confidential, binding arbitration before a single arbitrator, conducted via videoconference unless both parties agree otherwise, in accordance with the Rules of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC). Seat: <strong>[Insert Seat of Arbitration]</strong>. Language: English. Class/representative actions are waived.</p>
    <p>(c) <strong>Confidentiality &amp; Jury Trial Waiver:</strong> Parties shall maintain confidentiality of proceedings and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, waive trial by jury for any dispute arising from or related to these Terms.</p>
