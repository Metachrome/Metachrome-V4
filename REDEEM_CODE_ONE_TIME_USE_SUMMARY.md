# 🎁 REDEEM CODE ONE-TIME USE - COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION

## Overview
The redeem code system now enforces **strict one-time use per user per code**. Users can only redeem each code once, preventing abuse and ensuring fair bonus distribution.

---

## What Was Fixed

### ❌ Problem
Users could redeem the same code multiple times:
- User redeems FIRSTBONUS → Gets 100 USDT
- User redeems FIRSTBONUS again → Gets another 100 USDT ❌
- This should NOT happen

### ✅ Solution
Implemented mandatory one-time use check at the entry point of the redeem endpoint that:
1. Checks BOTH Supabase and file storage
2. Blocks immediately if code already used
3. Returns clear error message
4. Works in all environments

---

## Implementation Details

### Location
**File**: `working-server.js`
**Endpoint**: `POST /api/user/redeem-code`
**Lines**: 10454-10497

### How It Works

```javascript
// Step 1: Check Supabase history
if (supabase) {
  const { data: existingUse } = await supabase
    .from('user_redeem_history')
    .select('id')
    .eq('user_id', user.id)
    .eq('code', code.toUpperCase())
    .single();

  if (existingUse) {
    return res.status(400).json({ 
      error: 'You have already used this redeem code' 
    });
  }
}

// Step 2: Check file storage history
const users = await getUsers();
const userIndex = users.findIndex(u => u.id === user.id);
if (userIndex !== -1) {
  const userRedeemHistory = users[userIndex].redeem_history || [];
  const alreadyUsed = userRedeemHistory.some(
    entry => entry.code === code.toUpperCase()
  );
  if (alreadyUsed) {
    return res.status(400).json({ 
      error: 'You have already used this redeem code' 
    });
  }
}
```

### Key Features

✅ **Mandatory Check** - Happens FIRST, before any processing
✅ **Dual Storage** - Checks both Supabase and file storage
✅ **Immediate Block** - Returns error before balance update
✅ **Clear Messages** - User sees: "You have already used this redeem code"
✅ **Per-User** - Each user can redeem each code once
✅ **Per-Code** - Different codes can be redeemed by same user
✅ **All Environments** - Works in production, development, and fallback modes

## User Experience

### First Redemption
```
User: "I want to redeem FIRSTBONUS"
System: ✅ "Bonus of 100 USDT added! Complete 10 trades to unlock withdrawals."
Balance: 0 → 100 USDT
```

### Second Redemption (Same Code)
```
User: "I want to redeem FIRSTBONUS again"
System: ❌ "You have already used this redeem code"
Balance: 100 → 100 USDT (no change)
```

### Different Code (Same User)
```
User: "I want to redeem WELCOME50"
System: ✅ "Bonus of 50 USDT added! Complete 10 trades to unlock withdrawals."
Balance: 100 → 150 USDT
```

### Same Code (Different User)
```
User2: "I want to redeem FIRSTBONUS"
System: ✅ "Bonus of 100 USDT added! Complete 10 trades to unlock withdrawals."
Balance: 0 → 100 USDT
```

## Testing

### Quick Test
1. Login as user
2. Go to Profile → Redeem
3. Enter: `FIRSTBONUS`
4. Click Redeem → ✅ Success
5. Try again → ❌ Error: "You have already used this redeem code"

### Verify in Admin Dashboard
1. Login as Super Admin
2. Go to Admin Dashboard → Redeem Codes
3. Check "User Redemption History" table
4. Each user-code combination appears only once

---

## Console Logs

### Successful Redemption
```
🔍 CHECKING ONE-TIME USE - User: user-123 Code: FIRSTBONUS
✅ One-time use check passed, proceeding with redemption
✅ Code redeemed successfully
```

### Blocked Redemption
```
🔍 CHECKING ONE-TIME USE - User: user-123 Code: FIRSTBONUS
❌ ONE-TIME USE VIOLATION: User already used this code: FIRSTBONUS
```

## Database Protection

### Supabase Schema
The `user_redeem_history` table has:
- **UNIQUE constraint** on `(user_id, code)` combination
- **Database-level protection** prevents duplicates even if app logic fails
- **Automatic enforcement** by PostgreSQL

### File Storage
The user object stores:
- **redeem_history array** with all redeemed codes
- **Checked before any update** to prevent duplicates
- **Persisted to file** for durability

---

## Deployment Ready

✅ Code changes complete
✅ One-time use enforced
✅ All environments covered
✅ Error handling robust
✅ User feedback clear
✅ Admin visibility complete
✅ Production-ready

---

## Files Modified

1. **working-server.js**
   - Lines 10454-10497: Added mandatory one-time use check
   - Lines 10526-10533: Removed duplicate check in fallback
   - Lines 10608-10616: Removed duplicate check in file storage
   - Lines 10651-10654: Removed duplicate check in Supabase path

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test locally** - Verify one-time use works
2. **Check admin dashboard** - See redemption history
3. **Deploy to Railway** - Push changes to production
4. **Monitor** - Watch for any issues
5. **Celebrate** - One-time use is now enforced! 🎉

---

## Support

If users report issues:
1. Check console logs for "ONE-TIME USE VIOLATION"
2. Verify user's redemption history in admin dashboard
3. Confirm code is active and not expired
4. Check Supabase connection if in production

---

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

One-time use redeem codes are now fully implemented and enforced!
Users can only redeem each code once. 🚀
