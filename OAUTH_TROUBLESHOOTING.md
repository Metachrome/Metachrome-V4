# OAuth Troubleshooting - Google "Refused to Connect" Issue

## Problem
Google OAuth is returning "accounts.google.com refused to connect" error.

## Root Cause
This occurs because:
1. The Replit app may not be publicly accessible
2. Google can't reach the callback URL to complete OAuth flow
3. CORS/proxy configuration issues

## Current Callback URL
```
https://workspace.aloyarapbravy.repl.co/api/auth/google/callback
```

## Solutions

### Option 1: Make Replit App Public
1. Go to your Replit project settings
2. Make sure the project is set to "Public" 
3. Ensure the web view is accessible from external URLs

### Option 2: Alternative OAuth Implementation
For now, I'll implement a working demo that shows the authentication flow without requiring external OAuth callbacks.

## Working Authentication Methods

### 1. Email/Password (Fully Working)
- Demo credentials: trader1@example.com / password123
- Real backend authentication with session management

### 2. MetaMask Wallet (Fully Working)  
- Connects to actual MetaMask wallet
- Real Web3 signature verification
- Backend authentication with user creation

### 3. Google OAuth (Configured, pending accessibility)
- OAuth flow configured correctly
- Needs public Replit URL accessibility
- Will work once the app is publicly accessible

## Next Steps
1. Ensure Replit project is public
2. Test OAuth callback accessibility
3. Alternative: Implement OAuth simulation for demo purposes
