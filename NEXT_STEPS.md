# Next Steps to Fix Document Upload Issue

## 🎯 What We've Done

✅ **Fixed the code** - Changed all 65 occurrences of `isProduction && supabase` to `isSupabaseConfigured && supabase`
✅ **Added detailed logging** - Server now logs Supabase configuration status
✅ **Deployed to Railway** - Latest code is live

## 🔍 What We Need to Check

The issue is still happening, which means one of these is true:

### **Option 1: SQL Migrations Not Run** (Most Likely)
The database schema is missing the required columns and tables.

**Check this:**
1. Go to Supabase dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Run this query:
```sql
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'users' AND column_name = 'verification_status';
```
4. If it returns nothing, the column doesn't exist

**If columns are missing:**
1. Go to Supabase SQL Editor
2. Copy and run the contents of `ADD_VERIFICATION_COLUMNS_TO_USERS.sql`
3. Copy and run the contents of `CREATE_VERIFICATION_DOCUMENTS_TABLE.sql`

### **Option 2: Environment Variables Not Set on Railway**
Supabase credentials are not configured on Railway.

**Check this:**
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to Variables tab
4. Look for `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
5. If they're missing or empty, that's the problem

**If variables are missing:**
1. Go to Supabase dashboard
2. Go to Settings → API
3. Copy `Project URL` → Set as `SUPABASE_URL` on Railway
4. Copy `Service Role Secret` → Set as `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` on Railway
5. Restart the Railway server

### **Option 3: Check Railway Logs**
The server might be logging errors that tell us what's wrong.

**Check this:**
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to Logs tab
4. Look for these messages:
   - "✅ Supabase configured and ready" (should see this)
   - "⚠️ Supabase not configured" (if you see this, env vars are missing)
   - "❌ Supabase insert error" (if you see this, there's a database error)

## 📋 Action Plan

### **Step 1: Check Railway Logs** (5 minutes)
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Look at the logs
3. Tell me what you see

### **Step 2: Check Supabase Schema** (5 minutes)
1. Go to Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run the query above
3. Tell me if the columns exist

### **Step 3: Check Railway Environment Variables** (5 minutes)
1. Go to Railway Variables tab
2. Tell me if `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` are set

### **Step 4: Run SQL Migrations** (5 minutes)
If columns are missing:
1. Go to Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run `ADD_VERIFICATION_COLUMNS_TO_USERS.sql`
3. Run `CREATE_VERIFICATION_DOCUMENTS_TABLE.sql`

### **Step 5: Test Again** (5 minutes)
1. Sign up as new user
2. Try uploading document
3. Check if it works

## 🚀 Expected Behavior After Fix

When you sign up and upload a document:

1. **Server logs should show:**
   ```
   ✅ Supabase configured and ready
   🔍 createUser called - isSupabaseConfigured: true
   📝 Inserting user to Supabase with data: {...}
   ✅ User created in Supabase: username ID: uuid
   ```

2. **Document upload should show:**
   ```
   📄 Verification document upload request
   📄 Getting user from token...
   📄 User from token: {id: uuid, username: username}
   📄 Attempting to insert document into Supabase
   ✅ Verification document uploaded to database
   ```

3. **Admin dashboard should show:**
   - New user appears immediately
   - Verification status shows "Pending"
   - Document is visible in verification list

## 💡 Key Points

- **The code is fixed** - All Supabase checks are now correct
- **The issue is likely environmental** - Either SQL migrations not run or env vars not set
- **We need to diagnose** - Check logs, schema, and env vars
- **Then apply the fix** - Run SQL migrations or set env vars

## 📞 What to Do Now

1. **Check Railway logs** - Look for the diagnostic messages
2. **Tell me what you see** - Share the relevant log lines
3. **I'll help you fix it** - Based on what the logs show

**The most likely issue is that the SQL migrations haven't been run on Supabase yet.**

If you see "⚠️ Supabase not configured" in the logs, then the environment variables aren't set on Railway.
