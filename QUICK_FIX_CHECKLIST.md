- [x] File: `working-server.js` is ready

### Database Setup
- [ ] Run `ADD_VERIFICATION_COLUMNS_TO_USERS.sql` in Supabase
- [ ] Run `CREATE_VERIFICATION_DOCUMENTS_TABLE.sql` in Supabase
- [ ] Verify columns exist: `verification_status`, `has_uploaded_documents`, `verified_at`
- [ ] Verify table exists: `user_verification_documents`

### Deployment
- [ ] Deploy updated `working-server.js` to production
- [ ] Restart server after deployment
- [ ] Check server logs for any errors

## Testing Checklist

### Test 1: User Signup with Document
- [ ] Go to signup page
- [ ] Fill in: First Name, Last Name, Email, Password
- [ ] Select Document Type (ID Card, Driver License, or Passport)
- [ ] Upload a document file
- [ ] Click "Sign Up"
- [ ] Should see success message
- [ ] Should NOT see "Upload failed" error

### Test 2: Admin Dashboard

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If something goes wrong:

1. **Revert Code:**
   - Restore previous version of `working-server.js`
   - Restart server

2. **Database:**
   - SQL changes are backward compatible
   - No data loss
   - Can be safely reverted if needed

3. **Check Logs:**
   - Look for error messages
   - Check Supabase connection
   - Verify credentials

## Performance Verification

After deployment, verify:
- [ ] Signup completes in < 5 seconds
- [ ] Document upload completes in < 10 seconds
- [ ] Admin dashboard loads in < 3 seconds
- [ ] No 401 authentication errors in logs
- [ ] No database connection errors

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:
- [ ] Server logs for errors
- [ ] Supabase database for new users
- [ ] Admin dashboard for new user registrations
- [ ] Document upload success rate

## Success Criteria

✅ All tests pass:
- New users can sign up with documents
- Documents upload successfully
- New users appear in admin dashboard
- Verification status shows correctly
- No authentication errors

## Estimated Time

- SQL migrations: 2-3 minutes
