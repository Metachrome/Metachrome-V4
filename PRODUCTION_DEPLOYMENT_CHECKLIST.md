## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Database Setup
```bash
# Choose one of the following PostgreSQL providers:
# 1. Vercel Postgres (recommended for Vercel)
# 2. Neon (https://neon.tech)
# 3. Supabase (https://supabase.com)
# 4. External PostgreSQL instance

# After setting up database, update DATABASE_URL in environment variables
```

### Step 2: Environment Variables Setup
Set these variables in your deployment platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.):

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here-min-32-chars
SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret-key-here-min-32-chars
NODE_ENV=production
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com,https://www.yourdomain.com
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100
```

### Step 3: Database Migration
```bash
# Run with production DATABASE_URL set
npm run db:push
```

### Step 4: Admin User Creation
```bash
# Create admin user in production database
npx tsx create-admin.ts
```

### Step 5: Deploy Application
```bash
# For Vercel:
vercel --prod

# For other platforms, follow their deployment guides
```
